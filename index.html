            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jake Phelan and I am a senior at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Connecticut and have lived in London, Chicago, and New York City throughout my university career for various opportunities from studying to interning. This upcoming May of 2025, I will graduate from Northeastern with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics & Data Science. Following graduation, I will be moving to New York City to work as a financial engineer at a large asset management firm.

                I have always loved animals and in fact have 4 dogs and 3 cats, spanning between my familial homes in Connecticut and my college apartment in Boston. Of the animals that I have named myself, there is Lola (Bichon-Poodle, pictured) and Lorenzo (cat). I also have a passion for traveling, particularly internationally whenever possible. The next big trip that I have planned is one to Thailand with my roommate immediately following our graduation in May. My more local hobbies include weightlifting, taking spin classes, playing video games such as Elden Ring and Fortnite, as well as watching television and movies. My favorite television shows are Game of Thrones, Queer as Folk, Sex and the City, and the Vampire Diaries, among more. I hope this gives you an idea of who I am!
