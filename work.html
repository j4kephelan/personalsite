                    I completed my most recent internship with BlackRock in New York City, where I will be returning to work full-time postgrad in August of this year. I was on the financial engineering team here where I was responsible for two projects, each with a different subteam of the financial engineers. One project involved researching different information retrieval frameworks in order to implement a scraping pipeline to feed LLMs and the other project involved creating an app to test new versions of financial models before they are put into production.

                    My first and only Northeastern co-op was completed at UBS, a Swiss bank, in Chicago. I worked as a quantitative developer on a trading floor, specifically on a fixed income portfolio management team. I was responsible for scaling and maintaining an app which had been passed from co-op to co-op and is used for backtesting quantitative investment strategies, with stakeholders including traders and portfolio managers across the bank. I added many new features to the app including a new statistical signal detection method.

                    CATIC is a title insurance company in Connecticut, which means they insure homeowners and mortgage lenders against property title issues such as liens. I interned here for a few summers throughout the last years of high school and into my pre-co-op years of college. Here I was responsible for processing new title insurance policies received from our attorney clients and entering these policies into the database.
